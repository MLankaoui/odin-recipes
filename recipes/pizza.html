    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a popular dish that originated in Italy, consisting of a flat, round base of dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings. The dough is baked in an oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Classic toppings include pepperoni, mushrooms, and fresh basil, but the possibilities are endless, making pizza a versatile and customizable meal.</p>
    <p>Homemade pizza allows you to experiment with different flavors and ingredients, from traditional Margherita to creative combinations like barbecue chicken or veggie-loaded options. Making pizza at home is also a fun activity, as you can stretch the dough, layer the toppings, and bake it to perfection. Whether enjoyed as a quick weeknight dinner or a weekend treat, pizza is a universally loved dish that brings people together.</p>
