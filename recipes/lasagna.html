    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of flat pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel, and a variety of fillings like ground meat, cheese, and vegetables. The layers are stacked and baked until the pasta is tender and the top is golden and bubbly. It’s a hearty and comforting meal, often enjoyed at family gatherings or special occasions.</p>
    <p>The dish is highly versatile, allowing for countless variations to suit different tastes or dietary preferences. For example, vegetarian lasagna replaces meat with spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini, while some versions use gluten-free pasta or dairy-free cheese. No matter the recipe, lasagna’s combination of flavors and textures makes it a beloved favorite around the world.</p>
